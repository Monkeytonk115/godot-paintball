When exporting a large physics sim as an animation to be used in godot.
e.g. I made a nuke animation in blender, rigid bodies colliding ect.
to export correctly to godot, make sure under animation settings, the "Scene" option is selected.

This will merge all the animations for all the objects in the scene into a single animation file in godot.

knowing this will greatly decrease the time it takes to do this kind of thing in the future.

say thanks to past me
